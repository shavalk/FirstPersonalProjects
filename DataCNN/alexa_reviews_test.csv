1,Love it -- the best.  My experience with refurbished devices is excellent.
2,Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.
3,beyond awesome
4,"""I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product."""
5,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
6,We use Alexa primarily for listening to music and checking the weather. We are still learning other ways to use her. Everything has been ready and hands free so far. The speaker has great volume and sound!
7,"""Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too"""
8,"""Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn?t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."""
9,"""Love it , this time it's a gift  for friend"""
10,Barry
11,"""The sound quality is great, it now replace the echo dot in my kitchen."""
12,We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.
13,Device was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.
14,Sounds great!! Love them!
15,I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.
16,I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.
17,"""Love, Love, Love"""
18,"""We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed."""
19,"""I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can?t wait to see what else it can do."""
20,Very pleased
21,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.
22,Echo is good.
23,Excellent
24,Still learning it
25,the best
26,I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.
27,Works great!
28,This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.
29,Second dot.
30,Great
31,Very convenient and cool
32,"""I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device."""
33,Great sound and easy to set up. Purchased the Echo Plus because it had a built in Hub and would make it easier to connect to devices. I am hooked on Alexa!
34,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.
35,"""I?m very unhappy with this Firestick, every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay. We have 2 Roku?s That work just fine and are very quick."""
36,It's fun to use... I love novelty gadgets... And Alexa really works well for me...
37,Very easy set up. Really enjoying it
38,Purchased for grandson.
39,"""Had to return it as Hulu does not work on device.  It kept coming up with errors, and Hulu app not being able to open at times.  It was hit and miss, and at times, Hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie.  Plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps."""
40,"""absolutely an amazing device, very easy to setup and use"""
41,Didn?t really work as smooth as they make it seem like.
42,"""I do love it. Was easy to set up so far, but I wish it has a little more in the set up instructions. There is still a whole lot more I would like to be able to do with it and I have no idea if I can or not with it. But I really do like it."""
43,need a few more
44,"""My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!"""
45,I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.
46,I love it. It does everything.
47,Second dot.
48,"""Alarm and music, information the weather"""
49,Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.
50,Used twice not working!!!!!!!
51,I love the echo show awesome speakers I love the fact when you listen to music the words come up all around liking it so far. Also being able to read what's on your shopping list to do list and notifications
52,"""Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won?t respond or says she doesn?t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won?t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it?s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too."""
53,Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.
54,"""it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works."""
55,Love our little dot. I don?t know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.
56,Love it.  Great product
57,Love it! Very helpful
58,"""Always wanted one,till I got one, it's not at all what it's cracked up to be, it's hard to navigate I actually like the dot better."""
59,Best streaming device I've used in 5 years just wish the remote had a headphone jack like the Roku remote does.
60,Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!
61,Not much features.
62,Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.
63,"""these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs."""
64,I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren't labeled as refurbished I wouldn't have known
65,"""Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam."""
66,It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.
67,"""Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,"""
68,Ease of use!
69,Awesome! Easy set up. Linked right up with my Nexia home automation.
70,Works like a charm.
71,Works just fine.
72,"""It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you."""
73,A great product.  I would buy another.
74,"""I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol"""
75,I returned 2 Echo Dots & am only getting refund for 1. I returned 2 in one package. I want my refunds for both of them. They are in the same package. Can you not see them both???!!!
76,We all just love the TV fire stick and I would buy it again.
77,How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .
78,"""Great sound quality, works well with smart home devices"""
79,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.
80,Works like a champ.
81,Kids love it! I love it!
82,Absolutely love it!
83,Very impressed.  Simple to use
84,New device so still learning about it but works great for us when navigating Hulu.
85,Everything
86,"""excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns"""
87,"""I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."""
88,"""The sound quality wasn?t great, but it was inexpensive"""
89,I love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees
90,Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker
91,Bought it for my mother
92,great sound easy set up looks cool
93,"""Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do"""
94,Good sound works well
95,It?s awesome
96,Very happy
97,"""I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"""
98,Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.
99,I liked linking two more rooms in the home
100,I love it
101,Use it all the time and love it. Very quality product.
102,You need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It's going back very soon!
103,Love the product but dislike that I can?t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play
104,Fire HD does so much more.  Over priced pair of speakers.
105,Convenient and fun.
106,"""Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."""
107,"""Don't waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money."""
108,Access to apps
109,A great buy
110,Awesome. I love Alexa.
111,We are very pleased with this item. The display is clean and crisp and easy to read. We enjoy trying the suggested things to try asking Alexa. We use the timer feature quite a bit and have added our calendars and contacts. We are still exploring the many skills available.
112,Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!
113,A+
114,Love our echo! Thing the full size version sounds better though.
115,"""I like the fact that the messages are visual now as well as audible.I am puzzled because it will light up and make the &quot;notification&quot; sound but when I ask Alexa to read my notifications, she tells me that there are no new notifications.  This has happened at least once a day for over a week now."""
116,"""Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes."""
117,Amazing for all your entertainment needs!
118,Haven't used it enough
119,"""awesome thing, love Alexa"""
120,"""The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It's been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems"""
121,Very easy to install.  Very intuitive to use.  Very happy with the purchase.
122,Holy sound quality batman! This thing jams. It's insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around.
123,"""Like, all types of fun,music, and more"""
124,Son loves it.
125,"""Just getting started with the Fire TV Stick. So far, so good."""
126,Got it specifically to work with the August Smart Lock and it connected to it with ease.  Definitely ties the Smart Home together.
127,It was a gift.
128,I am in love with alexa
129,Poor sound
130,Love it!
131,Alexa us funny and enjoyable. Nice sound
132,I love it! Super easy to use. Hole the button and speak....takes you right to it without delay :-)
133,I really love my dots! So awesome how it?s connects all my rooms. But like you?ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I?m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don?t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%
134,neat tool we enjoy it with the family
135,Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.
136,Tremendous way to communicate with friends and family all across the country
137,Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!
138,"""Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  Audio quality is okay for the size."""
139,"""I set her up to play through our home theater system. So fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!"""
140,It plays music that I request.
141,Love the Echo Show.  Being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful!!
142,Like it to do more
143,"""I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."""
144,"""I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"""
145,product turns on randomly and sometimes at night
146,Not the best I have had
147,Its was easy to set up
148,Doesn't seem to hear as well as my 2nd Generation Echo and WHY is there no volume buttons on it?!
149,"""Sound quality is less than a dot, microphones don't pick me up as well as the other models (i have Echo and Dots).  Picture quality is good"""
150,Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don?t have a ?smart home? and don?t intend to make it one. But it?s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.
151,"""We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!"""
152,It is much more difficult to use than the Chromecast.
153,I?m never disappointed with amazons technology.
154,"""As Always, easy to set up"""
155,Amazon doesn't disappoint.
156,"""It has a screen, microphones, speaker, and alexa lives inside.  Yup it is an Echo Show.  Expectations met."""
157,Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa
158,It's like a remedial form of the Star Trek computer in your home
159,Eh. It?s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine
160,The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.
161,Love my echo. Love playing music in my room
162,Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha
163,"""This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."""
164,We are using the internet for our home and loving them
165,Excellent product and service.  Very easy to install and my daughter is very happy.
166,"""Works great I love it, grand daughter digs the watching of cartoons on it lol"""
167,"""She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa ?learn? Tasha?s birthday.  Or Alexa ?learn? my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"""
168,Worked as promised.
169,Very.god
170,"""The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."""
171,Works great no different than the new ones
172,It works just as well as the new version I got as a discount with my Echo speaker. I decided to purchase this version because Amazon states it has the same warranty.
173,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.
174,easy to use--amazing
175,"""When you think about it this really doesn?t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock."""
176,Speaker could be better qualty
177,I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.
178,love it
179,"""Great product, fun to use!!"""
180,Good buy
181,"""This product is a complete waste of money. When you ask Alexa a question """"she"""" either doesn't know the answer, gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of Wikipedia!"""
182,Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.
183,Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password
184,Was loving it but starting in June Hulu stopped working and crunchyroll doesn?t work either. Probably will switch to something else soon.
185,"""This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything."""
186,It's louder than the dot and it's got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house.
187,Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.
188,"""I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there?s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it?s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also."""
189,"""Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go."""
190,2nd one... more to come
191,Es perfecto.
192,works great
193,"""This thing is awesome!  I got it on Prime Day for a great deal.  I wish I had purchased two.  I also bought the Echo Show version, but the sound is not nearly as good as the Echo Plus.  The Echo Show came dented, so I will be exchanging it.  I like the screen and many of the features so I will not be getting a refund.  It was still worth the price."""
194,Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive
195,IT SEEMS TO BE OK BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WEAK AND I CAN NOT SEEM TO GET IT TO WORK. I AM GOING TO GET MY TECHY FRIEND TO HELP ME OUT AND I WILL UPDATE YOU LATER
196,LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.
197,"""I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office."""
198,"""Loved all about it, all I can do with it and it looks good."""
199,I love it.
200,Have now used for several months without problem.
201,I definitely like this product.  Wanted to be able to watch Netflix on my tv!  Easy to install!
202,Menu doesn?t work. Says it can?t connect to amazon network
203,Works. Replaced my expired bedside radio/alarm.It took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screen.Maybe it should said something during the setup process.
204,I love the Alexa remote and easy to use.
205,"""Disappointed that this device Is not able to access youtube as of Dec 2017. I wasn?t aware of that when I purchased it. I?ve had problems with my device. The voice stops working throughout the day. I can see it trying to respond to me, because the window it opens contains the info I asked about, but it?s like the device gets stuck in the process. It stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. I keep having to unplug and restart the device. Once I do that, it starts working again. So irritating. This device could really be a great device if Google and Amazon would act like grownups..."""
206,Poor product and quality
207,Iove it I bought it for my son because he wanted it and it?s awesome
208,Love it just wish I could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription
209,Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do
210,What a blast!  We love Echo...  Just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too!
211,"""I have the dot and Echo Plus, this one can't seem to &#34;hear&#34; me as well and doesn't do as much as I expected."""
212,I am in love with alexa
213,Cool
214,"""Working great this far.  Can't tell it's not new.  Will edit for longevity in a year, that's the real test."""
215,love it...just like the other 4 I own.
216,It knows everything  we ask it to do. Havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase. Sound quality is excellent also
217,I like the interaction of asking questions. I don?t like that I can?t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.
218,"""I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them"""
219,Speaker could be better qualty
220,great product!
221,For the size of the screen this thing should be $25
222,"""Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then."""
223,"""I?m not sure why or how Amazonia asking me about this purchase. I got it as a gift from my kids for Mother?s Day...  It was not bought from my account. Lil bit creepy ?. I haven?t really had much use for it as no one calls, they text. So that part meh. The other things it does are no different than the other Alexa products."""
224,Home
225,I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...
226,"""Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more"""
227,Not all that happy. The speaker isn?t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better
228,"""No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker."""
229,"""During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my """"smart"""" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"""
230,I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.
231,Amazing paroduct
232,Omg we love it!
233,Love it love it love it
234,Finally bought one but it couldn't find my Wi-Fi. Had to buy a Wi-Fi extended. My smart t.v. used the Wi-Fi just fine.
235,"""The echo doesn?t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient."""
236,"""I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."""
237,I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.
238,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.
239,It f****** sucks
240,"""I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."""
241,"""I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don't know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL."""
242,"""I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"""
243,"""Although this is my second echo device, I am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation/instructions as to the many functions of the device.  I purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  There needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  Or at least point out where it can be found..."""
244,"""This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home."""
245,This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)
246,I love it pretty cool.
247,Very easy to install. Voice control is great.
248,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.
249,Works awesome!
250,"""Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."""
251,"""Easy to set up, lots of things to watch and program in.  Have not even gotten that far into it yet.  Easy to use. Highly recommended.  Leaning more and more closer to cutting the cable cord for good."""
252,"""I used Chromecast before this, it was okay. But I love the FireStick. Works great, doesn?t lag. Would recommend!"""
253,The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.
254,We love our Echo Show!
255,Love it! It's everything I wanted and more
256,"""How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.)."""
257,"""Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices."""
258,The Echo Plus is used for leisure and pleasure. I absolutely love it. Easy to set up and connect. What a great addition to my listening pleasure. I have not used it yet for other purposes.
259,I really like it .
260,Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability
261,"""It won?t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won?t work"""
262,Absolutely love it!!!!
263,None
264,"""I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a """"smart home"""". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"""
265,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.
266,Works great
267,"""Got this as a gift... so cool!  I can view my news, recipes or shopping lists.  And much more!!!"""
268,I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.
269,Works great! Looks brand new! Love my new echo dot. I will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house.
270,"""Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off."""
271,"""Unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to Amazon."""
272,I didn?t order it
273,"""Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora."""
274,"""I didn?t realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick. I thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you Singley plugged into your tv. However, since using my amazon fire stick I have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all."""
275,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.
276,This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!
277,"""so far, so good, works great."""
278,"""I?m having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn?t work, the timer doesn?t ends... and Alexa keeps saying she is unavailable."""
279,Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!
280,Used twice not working!!!!!!!
281,Just what I expected....
282,"""I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!"""
283,I bought this for myself and i didn?t realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn?t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should?ve been more clear when i bought it.
284,"""For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn?t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don?t like that it?s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don?t. Lastly, I?m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven?t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually ?Alexa?."""
285,Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.
286,"""Works beautifully, excellent sound."""
287,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.
288,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify ?plus/prime/etc? account.  So you must pay to play ?your? music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is ?? .
289,The sound is amazing and many collections of all music
290,Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I?m across the room or busy doing something else.
291,"""I think I now have 5 of these throughout the house. So convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever, wherever."""
292,"""I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I'm very used to these devices. I don't need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I'm not a child and I don't need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn't Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders."""
293,Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.
294,She doesn?t always listen
295,Works good
296,I like it
297,"""This was an add on for my echo system, the refurbished product works like new!"""
298,I love my fire stick. It is so easy to use.
299,"""Love, Love, Love!!"""
300,Good but it?s pretty low
301,Works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.
302,"""As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful."""
303,"""It?s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don?t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it?s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it?s even better."""
304,All the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage. I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction
305,Love it!
306,It's like having your tv as a big tablet
307,works like any other one!
308,I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.
309,I have been through 4 Shows now.  And ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  It has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders.  I don't have these issues on my Dot or my Echo.  Just on the Show.  It would be nice if Amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing.
310,"""I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound."""
311,"""I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv."""
312,This is our 2nd one and we love it!
313,"""Got it for the smart hub and does exactly was it says, turn lights on and off, arm and disarm my security system and the thermostat is next.  Great.product!"""
314,We love the Fire TV Stick and will love it even more when we sever our cable connection when our service agreement expires.
315,"""I was contacted by people in India. Were they suppose to charge me $79.00? It was very hard to understand their instructions. They did have control of my computer and network. I, also, bought a Cloud Cam but do not know how to make it work with Alexa."""
316,I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices
317,"""Love it very much, still learning everything that my Echo can do, but am really enjoying the whole process."""
318,cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure If I will be returning it will try one more time.
319,"""A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited..."""
320,"""I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!"""
321,Simple set up.  Music everywhere.
322,I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights
323,It?s easier to do things with it
324,"""The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates."""
325,"""Very bad this device, I don?t know if it?s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded"""
326,Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.
327,"""AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine."""
328,Music mainly but still checking other features
329,Works great! Alexa finds all the goodies you could ask for!
330,"""The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing."""
331,Love all the options with the fire tv stick!Works great!
332,"""Doubtful at first, but it works a lot better than my smart devices.Plus Alexa software include, that was a plus!"""
333,I have the google home that I really like. The Echo plus I think has even a better sound and am totally happy with it.
334,"""I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."""
335,"""Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."""
336,"""Works beautifully, excellent sound."""
337,Still learning how to use it but like it so far. We played music from YouTube and a couple movies on it. No complaints
338,Makes accessing all of the Apps easy. Love the voice control.
339,"""Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet."""
340,"""I bought this on prime day and saved lots.I have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that I used for years, the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time. Very impressed with the clarity and volume.You will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio. That?s just a sad fact. It?ll play pandora and Spotify but it?s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptionDoes not stream YouTube music or YouTube audioApple users will be disappointed to see that it?s not as convenient as an apple deviceOverall, I still loved the device but I?ll be getting the DOT which has an audio out jack (as does the echo plus) and just connect to external speakers"""
341,Wasn't sure if I'd like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room! My daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. We've barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and I'm looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!
342,"""Very intelligent, love the songs ...."""
343,I bought this for my mother and she loves it! I want to get one for myself now!
344,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!
345,Great to have along with the Echo
346,It works great!!
347,Personal
348,It arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant
349,Love our little dot. I don?t know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.
350,Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!
351,"""I love being able to control lights, doors and music."""
352,"""I love the Echo Plus mainly because I don't have to worry about putting a CD, in to play. I just command a song and it plays. However; I was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the Echo. After consulting with Amazon and learning that I can purchase a portable Echo charging station I'm good.Sincerely,"""
353,"""It?s better than I thought, it practically turns your regular tv into a smart tv!"""
354,"""Love it , this time it's a gift  for friend"""
355,"""It's an echo with a screen, hence still needs work. Has me considering google home now."""
356,"""I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item."""
357,It worked as a charmed.
358,I did not know it needed to be plugged in to work. So far my experiences have been positive.
359,Totally enjoy our new Echo Plus.  Great for fast facts and listening to Beautiful Music.  We are just getting started with all the benefits.
360,I really expected more from the product
361,Love it. I play music everyday and voice  activated makes it so easy
362,Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn?t know. I thought she was supposed to know everything
363,We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.
364,I love all the viewing choices on FIRE STICK!
365,Love it to play music works great for finding recipes. Need more family to have adapted machines to see
366,"""It still doesn?t work.  I bet if I call and let them know that, they will charge me for the 3rd time.  Ridiculous."""
367,Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.
368,Makes me happy
369,"""great product, but useless overall. Too many unnecessary features. Unless you have a smart home you don't need it"""
370,Gave as a gift - they loved it.
371,Great product
372,"""Everything about it is great, love the Alexa voice remote"""
373,very nice and its does not take up space
374,"""I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well."""
375,Works great and it's so easy to use that my 4 year old can navigate it.
376,I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself
377,"""I?m really enjoying this product. Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more."""
378,"""I'm still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus."""
379,"""I wasn't sure I really wanted one of these, but now that I have it, it is extremely useful.  Get one, you'll love it!"""
380,Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.
381,"""works good, ni issues"""
382,Product forces user to review Alexa Things to Try. There is no way to disable it.
383,Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks.
384,The power cord attachment tends to come loose from the outlet. The adapter may be too long and heavy. Not a big problem but annoying. When the unit is plugged in it works great.
385,Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.
386,"""I do like the Fire Stick and I?m very close to cutting the cable.  I can find many movies and shows, while keeping my budget in check.  I?m learning how to maneuver around the channels and find my shows quickly."""
387,"""I love this thing. At first I thought it wouldn?t stay on the clock and that I would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it?s very comfortable for the eyes, easy set up. Love it"""
388,"""It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."""
389,Amazing
390,"""I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????"""
391,Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom
392,Easy to use
393,As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.
394,I love love love love it!  I feel like I have a talking computer that tells me EVERYTHING.
395,We held off purchasing an Echo but couldn't resist during Prime Days.  The Echo works great and it's nice to have the screen.  There is still a lot more we need to learn how to do.
396,"""I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!"""
397,"""Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it?s great that I was able to set that as default. There?s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He?s a lot more calmer and doesn?t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It?s a must have!"""
398,Great
399,Easily configured hub capabilities.  Excellent sound quality for the size of the unit.
400,Entertainment
401,Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.
402,I love my fire stick thank you so much
403,Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.
404,Love it
405,I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later.  It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer.  Its the Firestick. very disappointing.
406,"""Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it."""
407,"""My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions"""
408,Just like new
409,Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.
410,Using it to stream Amazon Prime and Netflix.
411,Family loved it!
412,From such a small speaker it sounds great
413,Works great no lag and is much better than the gen 1 devices I was using. I would recommend this if you have a 1rst gen and are tired of the lag and crashes.
414,Better sound.
415,CAN WATCH AMAZON PRIME SHOWS AND TALK TO ALEXUS
416,Awesome product!
417,Love it so much
418,"""Six words, &#34;Alexa, tell me a poop joke.&#34;"""
419,We love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.
420,Like new
421,"""like new, good refurbishing"""
422,"""Great gadget that installs, and works easily. Nice to not have another box taking up space too!"""
423,It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.
424,Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn?t close to salsa phonetically.
425,Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.
426,"""Sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn?t respond or you forget the correct command.  ?Alexa, turn on the living room lights?.  Oops I mean ?Alexa turn on the family room lights?. I also never realized I call my couch a sofa some times.  Unfortunately my Alexa is confused by my changing names for where I sit."""
427,"""Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. I didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I'm not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!"""
428,Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.
429,Great and easy to use
430,Love this! So many options!
431,The sound on these is terrible. It?s like a tin can. I love my echo but this item is awful.
432,"""Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet."""
433,It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.
434,"""Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!"""
435,Have had an larger echo for some time and love it. Bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.
436,We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound
437,"""I love the fact, that I can unplug it, and take it to my basement when I want do laundry."""
438,Great sound in a small package?easy to set up and use; fun to own.
439,The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.
440,"""I love it, wife hates it."""
441,Love Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don't know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to
442,"""Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it."""
443,Like
444,Have had this around a week.. I love that I can control items in my house even if I?m not there.. makes me feel better about being away from the house and people don?t know that we are gone.. Alexa has not disappointed!
445,Great sound from a little speaker
446,"""Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things."""
447,Works well
448,I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.
449,Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.
450,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.
451,"""Pretty cool device. Still have a lot to learn, but I'm changing channels on my Fios, and getting info needed. the speaker is great for what I needed it for, which mainly is music."""
452,This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*
453,Glad I bought this.
454,I have an original Echo and really like it. I wanted another one for my basement. I realize it isn't a huge stereo with settings but it doesn't sound bad at all. Definitely doesn't take up much room. Great price for the Echo Plus on Prime Day. I ordered two!!
455,Just got my third one. Love them
456,Shit
457,The setup of this device was simple and effective.  I am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of Alexa.  This is great for my mobility issues.  I now have the ability to have my shopping and comfort needs met without depending on friends and family.
458,Great
459,I can connect my smart lights and my phone. And any other smart device. It's just so convenient that I highly reccomend it to anyone who have the disposable income.
460,Well-made product.Echo Spot - White
461,Good price. Prompt shipping. Has been working flawlessly.
462,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!
463,On par
464,Great product at a great price.
465,I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.
466,"""We just got this within the last couple of weeks, from what we can tell no issues! My son wanted and &#34;alexa&#34; for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes, he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more. We all enjoy this one so much that I just bought a second one this week during Prime Deals Day!"""
467,I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.
468,These are great. I bought one and then bought another right away. Grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150. Highly recommended.
469,"""Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do"""
470,First time using Alexa and so far I love it.
471,not working
472,"""Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need."""
473,Great product. Very versatile and easy to use
474,Es  excelente funciona genial
475,I like Alexa
476,Prime video
477,Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.
478,"""I love it! Plays great music, movies, and so much more. I does lag when u want to see your arlo security cameras thou. So far so good. Wish it had a longer cord."""
479,Works great. Bought as a gift for my boyfriend. Easy & fun to use.
480,We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.
481,I love it!
482,works great
483,"""We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now."""
484,This is my first smart device and I will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.
485,This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!
486,love it
487,Loved them
488,Arrived as expected.
489,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.
490,We are loving Ours very much
491,"""I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked."""
492,Nice
493,Not all that happy. The speaker isn?t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better
494,its okay but keeps dropping wifi!
495,Very satisfied with the product
496,The way the music sounds is poor quality
497,I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.
498,It was very easy to set up and my family love it?s!
499,"""Very disappointed when we had to mandatory upgrade and when we final got done with the upload, we had lost our local Charlotte NC channels (which are pur news and weather also)  (CBS, NBC, ABC) and 2 days later was Amazon day with discounts on what we had JUST ordered."""
500,Loved it. No more cable bills for us.  I would advise anyone to get one. 2nd one bought.
