"""Great product, fun to use!!""",1
Excellent product !!,1
I absolutely love my Show!,1
Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker,1
Get rid of the &#34;Thongs To Try&#34; screen!!!!!!!!!! Numb nuts!!!!!,0
I enjoy the various functions of the device,1
"Good, very good",1
This thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying ?ready for setup?. It was already setup. Should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. Wife not happy...,0
"""Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!""",1
Works wonderfully.,1
"""I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I?m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many ?apps? you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I?m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.""",1
This is my second one. I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.,1
"""Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,""",1
Invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF,0
Love it,1
"""Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.""",1
"""I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.""",1
The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.,1
"""So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.""",1
great price great product fire stick is the best i think works better then roku.,1
Love the product but dislike that I can?t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play,0
"""It's constantly buffering, to the point where you can't watch anything without interruption. I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from.""",0
"""Love my spot! My favorite feature is the &#34;Alexa, start my day.&#34; I love that I can hear the weather, traffic and even the word of the day! It even goes right into my favorite podcast while I get dressed!""",1
Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.,1
"""Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot.""",0
Bought my first echo dot and loved it so I got this for work. Absolutely love it!,1
I love the number of movies that are available using this device. Took me a little time to setup and learn how to work it. The only thing I miss is local channels.,1
Works like a charm.,1
Worked just as good as the two new Echo Dots i preciously purchases.,1
Quality not on par,0
I Love it !! Used one like this in Philly while visiting my son and decided to buy my own on Prime Day !,1
While I loved Alexa....this is a whole new level. Love it. Fun to watch movie trailers. Weather is so much more complete. When you listen to music....the lyrics appear. Still discovering all Echo Show can do. Highly recommend. Takes Alexa to a completely new world.,1
"""I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.""",0
Arrived on time and works amazing!!!,1
I loved it does exactly what it says,1
Great product we listen to music all the time,1
Works great and easy to set up!,1
Love it,1
"""Este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor, perdió toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol""",1
"""I love the idea is the star trek computer at home. The skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre.""",1
Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom,1
It has all I need for my life plans time date music,1
It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.,1
"""I love this fire stick because after installing a few highly recommended apps, I discovered that a lot of the channels I don't have with my cable provider is included,  and I don't have to pay extra! Just subscribing to a few streaming apps will do and I still come out paying way less than cable tv.""",1
"""Just as advertised, bought as a gift, great price, fast shipping!!""",1
Nice product but as intelligent as we thought or had hoped.,0
So far all.i can say is I love it,1
I really love that all my apps are in one spot,1
The speaker sounds really good,1
"""Amazingly fun. My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don?t have it linked to my phone yet.""",1
It works,1
Love this wished I had gotten it sooner,1
"""Love it! I?ve listened to songs I haven?t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It?s great!""",1
Awesome!,1
The tech isn?t there. It doesn?t understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio,0
"""I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.""",1
this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!,1
This is the best Amazon speaker with Alexa in it.  But if you?re thinking it?s a good smart hub you?re wrong. Are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell Alexa to Turn them on and off. That?s it! You?re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices.,0
I really like the echo dot. It?s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.,1
wonderful product and fast delivery!,1
I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!,1
I don?t like that it goes into sleep mode after 20-30 minutes of ?inactivity?. I shouldn?t have to ?wake up? the fire tv to finish watching a show.,0
"""I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder.""",1
Love the Alexa feature. Firestick is working just fine.,1
"""Connecting and sound are perfect! I only give 4 because the is no internal battery, if I disconnect to the power source, it will be off.""",1
"""Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview""",1
"""Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...""",1
"""We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume.

"""Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.""",1
"""Very capable.  Language recognition is the best I've experienced.  Great sound, too!""",1

We got this as a wedding gift and haven?t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!,1
"""I loved how easy this was to install sry up, and use! Simply amazing.  So amazing we bought two!This allowed us to officially """"CUT THE CABLE CORD"""".Love it!""",1
of course!,1
Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!,1
"""Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!""",1
Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It?s great for my news updates too!,1
I really like the echo dot. It?s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.,1
"""Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!""",1
Love it!,1
"""I absolutely love this! Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I?m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces. I like digital but I miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them. I?d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices. I really have no complaints, I?m being nit picky at this point. Worth every penny!""",1
"""I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.""",1
Love the fire stick. Alexa works well on it too. Would recommend.,1
I like it,1
Very easy to set up and have no issues.,1
Works great with my existing smart home setup.,1
Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.,0
"""Works great! I recommend it to anyone who has prime, WiFi and an hdm1 tv. That?s all u need. I?m not really technologically savvy but even I was able to set it up with included and on screen directions.""",1
After only a couple of days Alexa did not answer. I have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting.,0
So far I love it.  It was easy to set up - if I can do it anybody can.  Speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command!,1
Sound very nice perfect for the price,1
"""Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.""",0
All of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.,0
"""My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her ?no? for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It?s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you?re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou?ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn?t live without.""",1
"""It,is,what it is and than some. Sounds great too. On,y thing I dont like the camera being seen by anyone working for amazon  I asked echo show to show me camera and didn?t know what I was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but can?t dhiw u what?s recording hmm""",1
Excellent why didn?t I think it is in the beginning I love it,1
My Father liked the added programing in which he is interested.,1

Works perfectly,1
Great easy to set up.A little difficult to navigate and the instructions are non existent,1
"""It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.

The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.,1

This is our second echo show.  We have a home in Mexico and one in the USA.  Now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other.  We can also drop in on the houses when we aren?t there to check on them.  We use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes.  We also have echo dots in various rooms.

Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box!

I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.,1
The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.,0

LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.,1
I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.,0

Like it. Still working discovery. Really too soon to fully evaluate. But looking forward to learning and using it.,1
Broke in the first week,0
Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.,0

This thing is awesome. We watch it more then the regular cable. Going to by more on Black Friday as Christmas gifts.,1
"""Alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need. She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed.

Happy with this as I was with the other 2 I ordered!!,1
Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.,1

I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.,1

Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes.

You don?t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it,0

I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.,1

it does everything that it offers.,1
I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!,1
The fact that she can help me find my phone when I am at home alone is worth the price of this device,1
Love the fire stick. I can download watch great movies. Instead of searching I use Alexa voice.  Prime doesn't offer very many newer movies is the only negative.I also wished there was a way you could set it up to post newest movies first.,1

Absolutely love it!!!!,1
"""After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.""",0

Setting up,1
"""This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn?t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying ?Alexa set an alarm for 5am? and then having Alexa repeat ?OK alarm set for 5am.?  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990?s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I?m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I?m in the shower.""",0

"""This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time.

The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing.

it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself,0

"""When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities.""",0

I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could.

Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn't work.""",0

Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything.

Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you?re up too close or to far the echo doesn?t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus.

"""Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.""",1
"""This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.""",0

This device is awesome!,1
I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.,0

"""I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I'm in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub's, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I've already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn't even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn't know it was a hub. But also because I didn't really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top.""",1

"""All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.""",0

I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I?ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I?m not sure if this is the norm or if it?s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don?t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic?s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple?s Siri is that when she?s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the ?Hey Siri? feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven?t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I?m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations ? support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can?t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would?ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item.

I have been waiting for the Echo Show to go on sale and it was worth the wait. It was easy to set up and start using,1
"""It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to.""",1
Amazing product,1
Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.,1
Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.,1
Love it.,1
The echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;Things to try&#34;. I am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. I found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. If I cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.,0
I love everything about the fire stick. It?s easy to use and Alexa makes it quicker to get to tv shows or music.,1
I loved it it works great,1
I love the size and the videos are a good quality.  The sound is awesome too.,1
It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!,1
Very easy to set up and use. Slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart home. Both Alexa and I are learning what we can do.  With each new item I am happier that I made the purchase.  So far my only regret is I didn?t do it sooner.,1
It?s awesome,1
"""I'm so happy that I purchased Alexa.  When I recently saw this at a friend's home, he played some music while talking about the product.  I love the sound & love that all I have to do is tell Alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately.  I haven't been able to listen to my CD's for a while since I have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it's not an issue any longer.""",1
"""It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I?m not around,,,,,no Spanish!""",0

It won?t receive calls and it?s really hard to call someone who has another echo.,0
Excellent product !!,1
"""This was purchased for our toy hauler, but it came the day before we left for a trip by plane.  It was wonderful to plug into our hotel TV and watch our normal tv shows rather than whatever was showing at the time and sit through commercials.""",1
I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.,1
Oh I love my Echo Show and the video news spots,1
Needs to play YouTube and prime video and maybe Netflix. But it has good sound,1
Thank you! Great Product!,1
"""Awesome, wish I had gotten one sooner.""",1
Easy set up,1
Love it,1
LOVE .. LOVE my Echo Plus !  So silly simple to set up .  Alexa has now become my new BFF.  Amazon 24/7 Support is hard to beat !!  Any questions answered any time ... What more can you ask for !!!,1
it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!,1
Second Dot work great for refurbishedThought it was new,1
I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.,1
Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!,1
"""It seems easy to stump Alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  We admit that we have not explored all that's available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.""",1
Up dated news,1
It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.,0
Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon,0
We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound,1
Definitely a really good buy for FIRST time buyers of smart home stuff =]I bought 3 =],1
Ideal when you have Amazon Prime.. My very first Fire TV Stick... I should have purchased one a long time ago.... I wish I bought 2 or 3 on Amazon Prime Day..... And not to forget the fantastic Alexa features..,1
Wish volume was capable of going louder,1
Does everything as expected and more.,1
Easy to install and operate. Works with Alexa voice commands.,1
This firestick is everything!,1
Refurbished is the way to go. My Echo works just like new.,1
Extremely happy,1
"""The sound quality is really quite good. I also have a Dot which is Bluetooth linked to a Grace Digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing Snell speakers, obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much. My only complaint is that you can't customize Alexa hot words. Now that I have multiple Alexa devices there needs to be a way to direct an Alexa command to a particular device. I would like to be able to talk to a device by name.""",1
Love that the fire stick allows me enough choices to ditch cable!,1
My first smart buy..I am loving it and all the great things Alexa can do.,1
Pretty cool. I have only begun to figure out things she does.,1
Great product,1
Love it... can't stop using it..,1
"""We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.""",0
Set up is so easy.,1
"""Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?""",0
"""Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.""",0

"""Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music.

Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.  Really can not recommend this item at the current time""",0
I feel that the voice feature is useless. Lots of channels to stream though.,0

Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.,1

The speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. Besides that naw,0
I have a friend now.,1
Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs,1

I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.,1
So far no major issues,1
Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.,1
"""I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off.  Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and  the Echo Plus with Hub.  Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!""",1

I can receive my CPR classical station.  Great sound.What I like least is the learning curve and my mistakes.,1

Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!,1
Liked 100%,1
So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!,0
This is our first Alexa.... we love it!!,1
Just the perfect cost effective solution.  Thank you Amazon.,1
Very satisfied with the purchase. The package came in good time and was just as expected,1

Alexa hardly came on..,0
Love it. Beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.,1
Cheap and cheap sound.,0
I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.,1
The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.,1
"""i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.""",1
neat tool we enjoy it with the family,1

It is awesome. I love being able to turn my lights on so I don?t have to walk into a dark home. I also get to video chat with my nephews who live states away by just asking Alexa to call.,1
Worked great. The built in hub works great.,1
I love the sound very good. We use it for home automation also works well!!,1
We got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once I did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do Text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the Echo so tech support can help setup the device ! I had to get a friend whos an IT guy to come help me setup,1
"""This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can?t wait to see what they come up with next.""",1

wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.,0
this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.,1
Works fine!!,1
I love having an Alexa!,1
Easy to set up and does everything it?s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.,1

"""Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.""",1
"""It seems to work well.  Unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or Youtube any more.  This problem is caused by Google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these.  This even effected my smart TV.  Anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we'll see what happens when we hand them out.""",0
"""I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.""",0
i love everything,1
Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!,1
I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected,1
"""This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with.

Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working?called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable?expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.,0
I live this item.  I bought several for each room in the house and as a gift for my Mom.  I also use mine to travel with.,1
Got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe. We showering.,1
I was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99,0

Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that?s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing.

"""At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.""",0

Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything.

I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.,1
Very easy to set up and straight forward directions. Loads fast also.,1
"""Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.

"""Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.""",1

Great product and easy to use,1
"""This was a Prime Day purchase. I'm still learning my way around it. So far, so good. The addition of Alexa is nice.""",1
"""I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots.""",1
I love it,1
I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.,1
I would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. Its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.,0
I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.,1
Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom,1
Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.,1
I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.,1
Thought it was pretty cool new to streaming thing seemed easy to use,1
"""Used for personal use. We like hearing weather, news from CNN, and various playlists.""",1
Works like a charm...,1
Love the music the stories,1
I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.,1
The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn?t anything I dislike.,1
Absolutely love it..  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  When playing  music with  Bluetooth speaker outside I have to go inside to change songs.,1
I LOVE my Firestick.,1
Great product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.,0
Like new,1
"""Installed on my back porch, works very well!  I did have to get the wall mount for it, which also works well.""",1
Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available,1
I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.,1
Good product.,1
works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.,1
"""Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!""",1
"""Nice. It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming.""",1
"""daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet.""",1
very easy to set up and very easy to use,1
"""LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!""",1
"""It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?""",1
It works,1
Easy setup very fun to use. Connects with all my smart home appliances,1
We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.,1
Using as a hub and music.,1
I purchased this refurbished.  Works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. Very easy.  Now I have echo dot that I can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.,1
Awesome product,1
My new BFF!,1
Amazing!,1
Really like it,1
Love it,1
It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.,1

Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!,1
Music. News. Shopping list. Jokes. Games,1
Everything,1
Enjoy using it.  Great sound.  Love the shopping list,1
"""We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.""",1
"""Not perfect but very good! A few times Alexa picked up something from TV, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions. Well worth owning and a good step to making my home Smart!""",1
Very amazing product. Great sound quality.,1
Great Purchase,1
Love it!! Great product!!!,1
"""the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;""",1
"""Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It?s far from being useful.Half the time when you ?wake? the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn?t hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It?s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I?m past the return period...... zzzz""",0
"""Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one.""",1
So far I like it ?,1
Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it,0
Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.,1
This is an awesome product. I wanted to test out the differences between this and my Roku and both are very nice. I will likely be using this for traveling as well.,1
We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.,1
"""Excellent product, set up with ease as well.""",1
amazon fire stick is amazing !!!,1
"""This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.""",1
"""Very intrusive, so I turn it off""",0
Great product and Prime Day price! Took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other Echo devices in my home. This came with a Philips smart bulb. It's better than having a clapper! I found instructions online to 'wake to music & philips light'. Very easy to set it up with the instructions. You even have an option of what song you want to wake up to!,1
It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...,1
The speaker could be better...,0
Great item.  I'm so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.,1
The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn?t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.,0
I bought 2 of these (plus 2 Echo Dot 2nd Generation) on Prime Days. Love the Echo Plus easy to setup. The reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free Philips Hue White A19 Single LED Bulb Works with Amazon Alexa. There is no one to call to find out why.,1
"""So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.""",1
Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house,1
Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.,1
Enjoying it so much!!!,1
Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.,1
"""I purchased the Echo Plus with built-in hub during Prime Days sale. It was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my WiFi. Also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. I love telling Alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away. Excited to learn new uses for it.""",1
"""I liked it until on day after a year it no longer worked, would not power up  and go past the firestick  logo on tv. Bought a second one, will not buy a third if this one doesn't last longer....""",0
"""So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.""",1
"""I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.""",0
My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.,1
Nothing to dislike and it does a lot more than I expected,1
"""I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account.""",1
"""Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.""",0
It works great and sounds good!,1
It is as if we are having a conversation with another person.  Instantaneous response.  And the fact that it catches your command even when you're far from it is simply just amazing.,1
"""Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!""",1
"""Seems to be a good product but, unable to play music in sync with my Sonos system. Sonos doesn't seem to recognize it at all.""",0
Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.,1
"""Great improvement over the original Echo.  Like the ability to see lyrics to songs, watch Prime TV and get other visuals.  The little hints about things to try that appears across the bottom sparks the imagination.""",1
"""So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or """"skills"""", but getting the hang of it.""",1
It works great!!,1
"""Love, love, LOVE!!!""",1
I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...,1
Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.,1
Ease of use.,1
Love it!! Still learning all the possibilities.,1
Easy to set-up and to use.,1
no habla espanol,0
Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn?t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!,1
"""Great product, easy to install and use! Not a necessity but a commodity!""",1
"""What can I say. Well, I?m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that?s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.""",1
Still leaning about it. The price was right!,1
Absolutely love!!,1
The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.,0
I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.,1
"""Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren't effective. It may be part user error or """"Alexa"""" becoming accustom to what is being asked.""",1
"""Fun to use, good sound quality""",1
Love it just as good as a new one,1
Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house,1
I have a friend now.,1
Love the functionality,1
Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.,1
Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!,1
I expected to have access to more current movie instead of having to pay. The easy setup was helpful and I love the speedy delivery.,1
The Echo Plus works as expected but I never received the Philips Hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase. Please advise.,1
A++++,1
Works like a champ.,1
It's Alexa.... what else can you say,1
Does not work all the time,0
Super good!,1
No YouTube,0
Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive,1
Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose,0
Its got to be one of the coolest things.,1
Love this just wish it had a built in hub,1
Kids love it! I love it!,1
Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!,1
Never really worked properly,0
works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.,1
Working great and my daughter loves it!,1
I love it,1
The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.,0
Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.,1
"""Very easy setup, and Alexa can be heard well and receive Very well.""",1
This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.,0
Exactly what I wanted with speedy shipping.....thank you so much!,1
Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.,1
"""Love this thing.. Best toy I've bought myself in awhile.. So far I have a smart plug connected running my Ac.  And the wifi light bulbs.  Baseball scores, weather are  cool but the music is the best feature.""",1
I love it. It does everything,1
"""I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.""",1
We have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can't wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!,1
"""Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more""",1
"""Love the Firestick! My kids love that they can talk to Alexa and get the weather, local news, etc.""",1
Very fun to use and having morning briefing,1
Works great - I put this in my son's room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv.,1
